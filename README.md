# pdf_to_text_webapp

View pdf documents from a GitHub repository only. There are four methods for viewing a pdf from a github repository: 
1. using a github repository url via non-cors fetch (fetch method)
2. using a github repository url where the data is downloaded to a blob url via a non-cors fetch (fetch method)
3. using a cross/non-github domain url where the data is downloaded to a blob url via a non-cors fetch (fetch method)
4. using a cross/non-github domain url where the data is downloaded to a blob url via a non-cors fetch (JQuery method)

## Url-to-pdf display webapp
Input any url and view the PDF document in the webapp. The webapp functions with FireFox and Chrome browsers, and with Android FireFox (trying to make it work with Android Chrome is in progress). If the PDF document can not be viewed, it means that the url is incorrect or the server where the pdf file is located does not allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and their server header needs allow permission for any domain to access their server resources.
